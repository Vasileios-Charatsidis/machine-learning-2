    "The (excess) kurtosis is a measure of 'peakedness' of a distribution. It is defined as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\\\verb+Kurt+[X] = \\frac{\\mu_4}{\\sigma^4} - 3 = \\frac{\\operatorname{E}[(X-{\\mu})^4]}{(\\operatorname{E}[(X-{\\mu})^2])^2} - 3\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Here, $\\mu_4$ is known as the fourth moment about the mean, and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation.\n",
    "The '-3' term is introduced so that a Gaussian random variable has 0 excess kurtosis.\n",
    "We will now try to understand the performance of the various activation functions by considering the kurtosis of the corresponding priors, and comparing those to the empirical kurtosis of our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, compute analytically the kurtosis of the four priors that you derived from the activation functions before. To do this, you will need the normalizing constant of the distribution, which you can either obtain analytically (good practice!), using computer algebra software (e.g. Sage) or by numerical integration (see scipy.integrate).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now use the `scipy.stats.kurtosis` function, with the `fisher` option set to `True`, to compute the empirical kurtosis of the dummy signals and the real audio signals. Can you use this data to explain the performance of the various activation functions?"
